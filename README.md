Simple Colorbox Reloaded
========================

A fork of the WordPress Simple Colorbox plugin. This plugin adds a Colorbox to your site with no configuration required. The fork is based on version 1.3.1 of [Simple Colorbox](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/) by Ryan Hellyer.

### Updates

This plugin is fully compatible with the [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater).
This plugin uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) to maintain its dependencies up to date.

### Changelog
- Fix compatibility issue with WordPress 3.8+ (the jQuery .live() method was [removed from jQuery 1.9](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#live-removed))
- Added support for the [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)
